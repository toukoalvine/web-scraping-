# web-scraping-
I’m currently working on a project as part of the “Data quality and data wrangling” modul in my iu-training program, where I’m demonstrating my web scraping skills to collect information from several web pages, extract the relevant numeric information and save the results in a format which allows for time series considerations.
in this task i will select at several web pages which list numeric information daily, write a Python script which scraps the numeric information from the web pages on a daily basis and Save the results into a HDF5 file.  
After the data collection, i will create a visualization which shows the temporal development of the respective values. Discuss the value added of your approach.
